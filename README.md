# Raytracer

This **raytracer** for simple shapes was build over the summer semester 2019 in the course "*programming languages*" at the *Bauhaus University Weimar*. The class started with acquiring the basic of C++ before going into the more complex aspects of the language. The course culminated in this final project, creating a raytracer from scratch.
